        <h2 id="1">Early life</h2>
        <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar Júnior or mononymously as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Brazil national team. A prolific goalscorer and playmaker, he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world and the best Brazilian player of his generation.[3][4][5] Neymar has scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs, making him one of the few players to achieve this feat.[6]
            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. Soon becoming the Brazilian's league star player, he won the 2011 Copa Libertadores with Santos, being their first since 1963. He was named the South American Footballer of the Year in 2011 and 2012, and relocated to Europe to join Barcelona in 2013. In his second season, as part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. Motivated to be the focal player at club level, Neymar unexpectedly transferred to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2017[7] for €222 million, which made him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] Despite recurring injuries and consequential limited game time in Paris, he was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season, helped PSG attain an historic domestic quadruple and reach its first ever Champions League final in the 2019–20 season, and established himself as the highest scoring Brazilian player in Champions League history.[10]</p>

        <h2 id="2">Club life</h2>
        <p>Youth
            Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered him a contract in 2003, where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed Peixe.[23] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team, at the time when Real had stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Robinho. He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos.[24][25]
            2009: Debut season
            Neymar made his professional debut on 7 March 2009, despite being only 17 years old. He was brought on for the last thirty minutes, in a 2–1 win against Oeste.[18] The following week he scored his first goal for Santos against Mogi Mirim. One month later, on 11 April, Neymar scored the decisive goal in a 2–1 win against Palmeiras in the 2009 Campeonato Paulista semi-final first leg.[26] In the final, however, Santos suffered a 4–2 aggregate defeat to Corinthians.[27] In his first season, Neymar racked up 14 goals in 48 games.[18]</p>

        <h2 id="3">International carrer</h2>
        <p>Following Neymar's performances for Santos in their successful early 2010 season, including winning the 2010 Copa do Brasil, in which Neymar was the top goalscorer, and the 2010 Campeonato Paulista, in which Neymar scored 14 goals, former Brazilian football players Pelé and Romário reportedly urged coach Dunga to take Neymar to the 2010 World Cup.[35] Although the widespread opinion that Neymar deserved a place in Dunga's squad went as far as a 14,000 signature petition,[35][198] and despite the huge pressure on Dunga to pick Neymar,[199] he was omitted from both the squad of 23,[200][201] and the stand-by list.[202] Although Dunga described Neymar as "extremely talented", he said that he had not been tested sufficiently on the international level to earn a World Cup spot and he had failed to impress enough while on international duty</p>
